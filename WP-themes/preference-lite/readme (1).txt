    Introduction:
-------------------------------------------------------

Preference is designed with a clean business style that is capable of handling almost any kind of business or personal website. You will find that Preference is not only flexible, but it's scalable, and will last you a very long time. One of the big bonuses of Preference (the free version) is that I've included the Twitter Bootstrap framework for responsive mobility on your favourite devices like the iPhone, iPads, Android phones, and others.

    Theme Capability:
-------------------------------------------------------

Preference comes with a different options panel for making custom changes to the visual aspects of this theme which is the Theme Customization API - But we will call it the Theme Customizer.
Accessing this customizer is done from one of two locations:

1. Your Dashboard home page by clicking on the big "Customize this Site" button (if this theme is active)
2. Going to Appearance >> Themes >> Clicking on the text link "Customize" on the active theme

This theme offers a lot of options, including a different style for your page background which has a split design view. 
This means the page background is in two parts with the top half using a colour background (which sits above the 
actual page background) and a bottom half which is where the "Background" setting for the theme is where you can 
use a solid colour, add a photo background, or even a pattern background.

You also get the ability to change colours for almost everything you see in your page with unlimited colour combinations 
to help you create your own personalized style with the built-in customizer.

You can make many changes to your theme from the customizer, such as:

1. Changing your site title and site description
2. Selecting and changing your logo
3. Changing your theme website colours for almost every thing in your pages
4. Customize the Showcase Header area
5. Changing the page background (the lower half of the front-end). The top half is designed to stay in place but is also customizable.
6. Choosing your menu and customizing it
7. Choosing if you want a static page for your front page or keeping it as the blog

    WARNING: BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------

Please do not edit style.css or any other Theme files or Templates directly. 
If you do, your customizations will be lost as soon as you update this theme.

WordPress and Styled Themes highly recommends using a Child Theme.
